				<h1 style="border: 2px solid Tomato;"	<h1> MY PROFILE</h1> 
				<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">
					<p>Personal Information</p>
					<p>	Name: Charlie Haywood-Cruddas</p>	
					<p>	Student Number: s3812554</p>
					<p>	Email Address: s3812554@student.rmit.edu.au/ charlieh-c@hotmail.com</p>
					
					
				<h1 style="border: 2px solid Tomato;"	<h1> MY BACKGROUND </h1>
				<h1 style="font-size: 20px;">	
					<p> I was born in London, England in 1995 and moved to Australia in 2005. Growing up the majority of my entire family was not religious in any form and that has continued throughout my upbringing and the future.</p>
					<p> I am hoping later on in life to move back to England or Canada as I personally don't enjoy hot weather and a personal view of mine is that I would rather it be freezing than swelting hot as it is much easier to warm up
						than it is to cool down.
					<p> This course would be a great start in improving chances in the future for a career I would enjoy and be proud of instead of the 'Dead End' jobs I have been working lately.</p>
					<p> I graduated high school in 2012
						and since then have been attempting other courses such as the the Bachelor in Chemistry I signed up for straightout of school, which I later dropped out of as the course outlines and overviews didn't outline the other monotonous subjects
						that had nothing to do with the field I chose but still needed to go through with the degree. I also signed up for a Bachelor in Criminology a few years back and the same thing happened with the last course with subjects I didn't much care for.</p>
					<p> I enjoy many different pastimes and hobbies which include football(soccer), gaming and content creation on youtube, scambaiting [which is really fun] and spending time with the missus. We have three cats [all brothers] and we used to have two dogs
						but when we moved from Kingaroy down to the Gold Coast we had to find new homes for them </p>
						
				<h1 style="border: 2px solid Tomato;"	<h1> MY INTEREST IN I.T </h1>
				<h1 style="font-size: 20px;">
				<p> I didn't always have an interest in I.T but when I began teaching myself C# [only the basics] I developed a longing interest in a career in I.T as at the time I was in a factory job which paid well but wasn't leading anywhere.</p>
					<p> I then started looking up careers in cyber security as from the future a job in the I.T industry can be a great field as technology only ever evolves and our understanding of it can only get better, which is why I was intrigued by this course so I can learn all the
						basics while continuing to teach myself on the side.</p>
					<p> I chose RMIT as I just recently bought a decently powerful PC and I wanted to use it to further my career and I figured studying online would be the way to go as I have tried on Campus studying twice before 
						and it wasn't for me, with online studying it means I can go at my own pace [within reason obviously] and with my dodgy sleeping pattern I can just watch the recordings and work in the middle of the night.</p>
					<p> As of late I have been earning some side cash building websites for 
						my mum's workplace and also my partners friend will also be needing thier websites constructed so I think that couldn't have happened at a better time as it will no doubt help in the future.</p>
						
				<h1 style="border: 2px solid Tomato;"	<h1> MY IDEAL JOB </h1>
				<h1 style="font-size: 18px;">	
					<p> My ideal job would be to work in cyber security or in the game design industry as both have an intriguing aspect around them and it would definately be a career I am proud of, I would also have no problems after this course entering into another one more encompassed around those career
						choices but I chose this course first before those ones as this I believe would help me more in the courses than just going straigh in without too much knowledge other than what I have taught myself.</p>
					<p> The skills that would be needed in either of these job opportunities would be to have good organization and data analysis skills and to do both quickly and efficently which is learnable, previous experience in a date analysis role
						which creating websites and maintaining them throughout its tenure wouldn't be 100% accurate but a decent step in the right direction.</p>
